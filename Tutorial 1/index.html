        <h1> JS Introduction</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a lightweight programming language commonly used by web developers to add dynamic
            interactions to web pages, applications, servers, and even games.
            animated graphics, element color slide shows or other dynamic features are mage through JS.
            It works seamlessly alongside HTML and CSS, complementing CSS in formatting HTML elements while
            providing user interaction, a capability that CSS alone lacks.
            Originally run on the client-side, the JavaScript implementation has branched out to the server-side
            after the **Node.js** development ‒ a cross-platform server environment built on the Google Chrome
            JavaScript V8 engine.
            While it caters to web-based programs the most, JavaScript programming features have other implementations
            in different areas. The following are several basic uses of JavaScript.</p>

    <p>There are 2 methods of integrating js in web applications</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            By using the script tag and adding js into that tag
        </li>
        <li>
            BY linking the .js file into the src of script tag
        </li>
    </ol>
    <script>

        alert("HELLO WORLD");
        alert("hey");
        prompt("enter your name");
        confirm("Are you sure you want to add this number?");
        
        // var a = prompt("Enter your number");
        // console.log("your number is" + a);
        // console.warn("warning");
        // var isTrue=confirm("Are you sure you want to add this number?");
        // if (isTrue){
        //     console.log("It is running");
        // }
        // else {
        //     console.log("computer is not blasting");
        // }
